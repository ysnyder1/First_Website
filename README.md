This was my first website. It was a lot of fun building it, but there 
are some obvious areas of improvement. One of those is in getting the 
proportions to fit all computer screens. Although the majority of the 
CSS uses percentages, I still had issues with differing displays. For my 
second website I would like to make a personal resume website.
